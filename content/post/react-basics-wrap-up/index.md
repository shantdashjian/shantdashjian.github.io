## React Basics Wrap-Up
Yesterday I submitted the MVP for the Quizzical solo project, the capstone project of Module 11: React Basics. This 
is a huge deal. This is module 11 of 13 modules total in this program. This list sums up the concepts I reviewed here:
1. Why React: Imperative style, components, profitable skill, and huge community.
2. JSX: HTML in JS
3. Components: Your building blocks.
4. Styling: className
5. props: Passing immutable data to children.
6. .map(): convert array items to elements.
7. event listeners: onClick
8. useState: Remember component data that will change, be used for display, and trigger re-rendering.
9. conditional rendering: Change display based on data.
10. forms: Use controlled input values.
11. useEffect: To get data from APIs, pass data between non-parent-child components, and do things in response to 
    state change.

I already submitted my project for review. I will present it in the upcoming Monday weekly meetings. In addition,I 
will 
add a new feature to it today for showing time taken to answer the questions.
