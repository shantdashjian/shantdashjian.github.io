## Spring
I kicked off the Spring Certified Professional learning path yesterday. Key learnings:
1. You initialize a new Spring-based application using `spring initializr`. It's 3 steps:
   1. Fill out metadata
   2. Pick dependencies
   3. Create the project
2. Spring makes JEE development easier. Spring Boot made Spring development easier.

## Frontend
Module 5 of the Scrimba Frontend Developer Learning Path starts with the following:
1. Get a modal in a position fixed to the view port, setting top, left, right, and bottom to 0, and setting the 
   margin to auto
2. Use `setTimeout()` to do sth after a delay
3. Use `preventDefault()` 
4. Modify the style of an element
5. Use the `<form>` tag 
6. Use the `required` attribute
7. Three `type`s of buttons:
   1. `submit`
   2. `reset`
   3. `button`

## Habit
My approach this sprint is to build habits by doing the following daily:
1. **Blog:** This gets me summarizing my learnings from the day before, producing content, forcing my brain to 
   remember, 
   which is how you know you learned something new.
2. **Mentor:** Teaching is an excellent way to solidify what you know, and it helps others grow.
3. **Study and Code:** Every day, I will make progress studying and coding through:
   1. Spring: 4 lessons
   2. Frontend: 20 lessons
