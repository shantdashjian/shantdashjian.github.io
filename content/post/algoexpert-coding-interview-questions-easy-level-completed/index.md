Today I solved a couple of [coding interview questions from AlgoExpert](https://www.algoexpert.io/questions): 
1. Insertion Sort.
2. Selection Sort.

With 
that, I realized that I have completed 
all 
31 Easy Level questions. I also have solved 6 of the Medium Level ones so far. 

In total, I have solved 37 questions in this iteration of preparation for acing my coding interviews. I keep 
making progress every day.
My next goal 
is to solve all 73 Medium Level questions. Before I reach that, I'll have 
unlocked **the AlgoExpert Certificate**, which is due when one solves _100 questions_. 

**Code on Shant!**
