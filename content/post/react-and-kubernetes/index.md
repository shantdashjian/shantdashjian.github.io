## React Basics
Yesterday I went through the `props` concept in React. It's passing data to a component to enable dynamic websites 
and code reusability. It includes passing an aobject and a non-string prop, destructuring, and spreading. I also 
studied mapping an array to a group of components.

## Kubernetes
I started re-studying for the KCNA exam. I aleady went through the official Linux Foundation course. This time I'm 
going through Andrew Brown's free KCNA course, which comes with a free practice exam. I'd dedicate a couple of hours 
for that KCNA stuy, to be done on 10 days. The exam focuses mainly on k8s fundamentals and container orchestration, 
with cloud native architecture, observability, and delivery. 

## Learning Such That It Sticks
I went through a video summarizing the book **Make It Stick** by Henry Roediger et al., which says:
1. Avoid passive learning and time-consuming useless learning.
2. Do retrieval practice and quiz yourself regularly. 
2. Do Effortful learning and ignore easy learning.
3. Do spaced repetition.
4. Do interleaved practice.
5. Stop to reflect. Don't binge.
6. Focus on the basics. Learn via gradual accumulation.
7. Learn from your mistakes.
