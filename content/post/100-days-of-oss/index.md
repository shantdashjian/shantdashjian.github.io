I joined [Open Sauced](https://docs.opensauced.pizza/community/100-days-of-oss/) #100DaysOfOSS. It's a global event 
that promotes open source software and aims at helping beginners grow, gain experience, and contribute to the OSS 
community.

The event started on July 23. Here is what I did since the event started:
1. **D1, July 23:** I communicated with Ashley Davis, author of the awesome book Bootstrapping Microservices, 2nd 
   Edition. I reviewed his test run of his course based on the book and gave him my feedback. I also shared a couple 
   of suggestions/corrections for the book. Lastly, I sent him my testimonial for the book since I am one of the 
   early readers of the book.
2. **D2, July 24:** I spoke with Micha from Scrimba about the [bootcamp exclusive Bootcamp Collab OSS project]
   (https://github.com/michaella23/bootcamp-collab/) and ways to improve student engagement and future ideas in 
   regard to OSS education.
3. **D3, July 25:** I learned about #100DaysOfOSS while attending Scrimba's weekly Town Hall and decided to join the 
   event.
4. **D4, july 26 (Today):** I'm writing this blog to keep track of what I've done so far. I officially signed up for 
   the event. I also approved a PR for the Scrimba bootcamp OSS project where I'm a **maintainer**.
