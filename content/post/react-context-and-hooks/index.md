## React Context
Yesterday I reviewed the React Context section. It explains:
1. **The Problem:** Prop drilling more than 2 layers
2. **The Parts:**
   1. Provider
   2. Consumer
   3. The Context tunnel
3. **Techniques:**
   1. `contextType`: This is limited to class components and cannot be used to pass on functions.
   2. **Separate components with render props:** This can be used for functional components and to pass functions.

## React Hooks
I also went through the first part of the Hooks section. In it I reviewed:
1. `useState`
2. `useEffect`

And I'm building a cool **Speed Typing** app along the way.
