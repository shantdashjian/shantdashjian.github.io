Here are the key concepts of Markdown notation. See this [commonmark.org tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/) 
for details:

1. **italic & bold**
    ```
   *italice*
   **bold**
   ```
2. **heading**
    ```
   # H1
   ## H2
   ...
   ```
3. **link**
    ```
   [this link](www.url.com)
   ```
4. **image**
     ```
   ![this image tag](image-url.com)
   ```
5. **blockquote**
    ```
   > This line
   > 
   > And this are on eblock quote
   ```
6. **lists:** I learned that I could number all items with `1.` which will make it easy to edit to reorder without 
   having to renumber all items. 
    ```
   - item
   - another 
   - and another
   
   1. this 
   1. that
   1. and the other
   ```
7. **code**
    <pre>
   `inline code`
   
   ```
   lines of code
   ```
   </pre>
8. **escape**
    ```
   1\. this is no longer a list item
   ```
9. **line break**
    ```
   line\
   another\
   ```
10. **paragraph break**
    ```
    dfdfdfdfd
    
    dfdfdfdfdf
    ```
11. **nesting**
    ```
    Put 4 spaces before each line:
        item
        item
    ```
