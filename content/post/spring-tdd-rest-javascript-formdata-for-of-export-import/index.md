## Backend with Spring
The two key concepts I went through yesterday were TDD and REST. The project-based course uses test-driven 
development which is a nice treat. By the end of this learning path, I'll have solidified:
1. Spring
2. REST APIs
3. TDD

## Frontend with JavaScript
On the frontend side, I reviewed important concepts like:
1. `FormData()` and its `get()` method
2. The nicer way **of** for, `for ... of`
3. How to modularize your code using ES6's `export`, `import`, and `type="module"`
