I enjoy teaching. I always have. The earliest I remember doing it I was only 14 years old. The first time I got paid 
to do it I was 20 years old. Over the last 30 years of me teaching, I taught Math, English, Programming, Software 
Development, and many other things. I'm 44 now, and I'm still teaching, professionally. I am currently doing it 
part-time, mentoring software development students. This includes:
1. Code reviews. **I've done more than 100 code 
   reviews over the last 3 months.**
2. Pair programming.
3. New concepts.
4. Refactoring.
5. Debugging issues.
6. UI design.
7. Reading API documentation and using it to build client fetch requests.
8. Resumes reviews.
