## Code Reviews Accelerated
I just completed my 8th code review of Scrimba students' solo project. With it I reviewed up to module 6, responsive 
design. I had 2 more to go.

## Promises
I also started the Async JS section of Module 9. I learned that async/await is syntactic sugar on top of promises, 
which are syntactic sugar on top of callback functions. Promises have three states:
1. Pending
2. Fulfilled
3. Rejected
