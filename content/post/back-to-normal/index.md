After a week-long break spend with family, I'm back to my normal routine. During this break:

1. I got myself a couple of books:
   1. **Java in a Nutshell**, by Ben Evans.
   2. **Cybersecurity**, by Duane Wilson.
2. I performed 7 code reviews.
3. I read through all **Cloud Native Spring in Action** chapter summaries and realized I could go through the 
   entire book in 60 days.
4. I studied through **Java in a Nutshell's** Chapter 1, the Introduction to Java, and also started Chapter 2, Java 
   Syntax. It's 3 out of 44 days for this book.
