## Practice React Basics
The last section of Module 11 is all about practicing React basics. Things I looked at:
1. Lazy state initialization: It's when you pass on a function as the initial value of the state. The function only

2. `split('\n')[0]` to get the first line from a string.

## Study K8s and Cloud Native Essentials
In preparation for taking the KCNA certification, I'm studying Kubernetes and Cloud Native essentials via a Linux 
Foundation course. Yesterday I went through the Cloud Native Architecture chapter. It included:
1. Characteristics of Cloud Native Architecture
2. Autoscaling and serverless patterns
3. Open standards, community projects, and CN roles
