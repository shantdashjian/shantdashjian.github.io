## Spring
Yesterday I kicked off the Spring certification learning path. The path consists of 4 courses, totaling 120 lessons, 
over 26 hours. The first course is about building a REST API with Spring Boot.

What was a pleasant surprise in the learning path is that it follows TDD and emphasizes security. Those are two 
important practices that go beyond solid Spring knowledge.

## JavaScript
Key concepts I went through yesterday:
1. FormData and the get method
2. The `disabled` property
3. The `classList.toggle()` method
4. The `aria-label` attribute
5. `for of` loops
6. exporting and importing and the `type="module"`
