Starting today, I'm using a new format for my *Focused Learning Path* to organize my daily tech-related activities. 

I created a list of 5 checkboxes to be checked daily. This way the **Right Now** step is always to **check the next 
box!**.

I started with the following 5 checkboxes:
1. Blog about what you learned yesterday. This is the morning write-up step = retrieval practice.
2. Record 2 Code Reviews.
3. Solve 2 JavaScript Coding Interview Challenges.
4. Study 3 Hours of the Exponent's Complete SWE Interview Course.
5. Study and code through 10 Pages of the Cloud Native Spring in Action book.
