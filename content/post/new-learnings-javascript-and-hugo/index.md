Yesterday I kicked off blogging using Hugo. I also carried on with Scrimba's Frontend Developer Path.

## Hugo
**What:** Hugo is a lightweight framework for building static websites that are fast.

**Why:** Blogging the next day enhances learning. It enables producing knowledge which is the next necessary step after 
consuming knowledge. I decided to use Hugo as it is lightweight and comes with very nice themes to pick from. I 
picked a themes based on VMWare's Clarity Design System.

**How:** It's very easy to get going. 
1. Install Hugo
2. Create a new site
3. Add content
4. Configure the site
5. Publish it

I copied the theme's example site as it gives me a good starting point. I also added a GitHub Actions workflow, so 
   that I have a nice deployment pipeline that takes my changes to production immediately.

## JavaScript
I continued with learning frontend skills and gaining hands-on experience using Scrimba's Frontend Career Path. 
Yesterday I re-started Module 5: JavaScript Essentials. Key concepts I went through yesterday:
1. How to have a modal removed from the normal flow of elements and get position fixed to the view port. The 
   steps in CSS are:
   1. `position: fixed;`
   2. `top: 0px;`
   3. `left: 0px;`
   4. `bottom: 0px;`
   5. `right: 0px;`
   6. `margin: auto;`
2. Hide an element using `display: none;`
3. Use `setTimeout()` to run some function after a set timeout in milliseconds.
4. Change the style of an element using `[element].style.[property] = "[value]"`
5. Forms and submitting forms
