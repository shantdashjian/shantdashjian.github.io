Chapter 1 is **Introduction to Cloud Native**. In this chapter I learned:
1. Cloud native is an approach to software development which involves designing, developing, and deploying 
   distributed systems in the cloud to take advantage from the cloud. It aims to achieve scalability, resilience, 
   agility, and lower cost.
2. Cloud native applications are:
   1. Scalable
   2. Resilient
   3. Loosely coupled
   4. Observable
   5. Manageable
3. In this book I will use:
   1. Programming Language: Java 17
   2. Framework: Spring Boot 2.7
   3. Container: Docker
   4. Orchestration: K8s
   5. Cloud: Digital Ocean
