Yesterday I decided that it's time to be building stuff every day using the technologies I say I know. I went 
through **Web Dev Simplified's** 43-minutes video building a **todo list** with React 18. I did it incrementally in 6 
iterations, each time building the app up to a point in the video. Progressively I was able to go through the entire 
video and with it built confidence that I could do this daily. Last time I checked, it took me 30 minutes to build 
the entire app. As I build this app with ease I show that I have a good grasp of React's basic concepts:
1. JSX.
2. What is React?
3. How to think in React:
   1. Build the whole UI in one component, statically without any data.
   2. Add state
   3. Break it up into components.
4. Components.
5. Declarative programming.
6. `useState`
7. `useEffect`
8. `map`
9. Using `vite` to create a React app.

I plan on building this same todo list app using React every day for the next 30 days. It will become so easy. This 
is building an incredible amount of confidence.

**I can now say with confidence:** 
> Yes, I can React. 
> 
> I can build an entire Todo List using React in 30 minutes.
