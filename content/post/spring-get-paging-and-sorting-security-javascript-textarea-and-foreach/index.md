## Spring
I studied:
1. GETing a list of items, using paging and sorting
2. Spring Security: This is a large topic. Yesterday I looked at the pillars of software security: authentication 
   and authorization and how to implement basic authentication in Spring.

## JavaScript
I looked at:
1. `testarea`
2. `forEach()`, a method to iterate over arrays.
