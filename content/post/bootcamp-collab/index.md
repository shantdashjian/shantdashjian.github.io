Yesterday we held a coding workshop focused on the [**Bootcamp Collab Project**](https://github.com/michaella23/bootcamp-collab). This project was initiated by the [wonderful Scrimba mentor Michaella Rodriguez](https://github.com/michaella23) as a safe playground for bootcamp students to practice contributing to open source 
projects. 

I have been an early contributor to this project and used it to strengthen my OSP contribution skills. Check out the 
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/michaella23/bootcamp-collab/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the 
project which outlines the contribution workflow for new contributors.
