I will finish reading the book **Cloud Native Spring in Action** by **Thomas Vitale** by the end of November. Why:
1. I will learn a lot about my profession by reading it.
2. I got KCNA-certified so that I could read through it more easily.
3. It will help me gain the experience for the system design interviews I am preparing for.
4. I will build something awesome while reading it.
5. It has been bothering me that I haven't read it yet.
6. It will solidify my 3 years of experience in cloud native development in the JVM ecosystem.
