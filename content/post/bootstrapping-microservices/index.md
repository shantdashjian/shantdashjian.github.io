Today I finished reading and working through the awesome book [Bootstrapping Microservices, by Ashley Davis](https://www.manning.com/books/bootstrapping-microservices-second-edition).

What I accomplished:
1. I build the complete [FlixTube application](https://github.com/shantdashjian/flixtube) along the way. This helped 
   me solidify my hands-on experience with a rich list of technologies:
   1. JavaScript
   2. Node.js
   3. Express
   4. Docker
   5. Docker Compose
   6. Kubernetes: kubectl and Kubernetes Dashboard
   7. Azure cloud: File storage, container registry, kubernetes services
   8. Terraform
   9. GitHub Actions workflows for Continuous Deployment
   10. MongoDB
   11. RabbitMQ
   12. Microservices
   13. Cloud Native
2. I contributed to the development of the book by submitting a number of suggestions to improve the text directly 
   to the author. This is because I was reading the book as it was written, with early access to the chapters.
3. I also contributed to the development of a future course still under development that will accompany the book by 
   reviewing the first test run and providing the author with my suggestions for improvement.
