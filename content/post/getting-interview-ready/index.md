I'm getting ready for interviews. I have a list of items I'm going through for my preparation. I also 
dedicated 3 months for this process.

I'm currently preparing for SQL interview questions. I went through the SQL fundamentals course on Exponent. I also 
solved 
all the interview questions and watched a few of the SQL interview videos. Next I began studying with the excellent 
book "Practical SQL", by Anthony DeBarros. I already completed 9 out of the 20 chapters in the book.
