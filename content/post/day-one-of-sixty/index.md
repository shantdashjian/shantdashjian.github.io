Today is Day 1 of my Sixty Days to Cloud Native Spring plan in which I am planning on doing bold things, which include:
1. *Study through the entire **Cloud Native Spring in Action** book:* This is the main objective for the next 60 days. 
   By the end of it, I will have built a bookshop application showcasing solid cloud native Spring implementation. 
   This will be an impressive project which will demonstrate what I learned over 3 years of working as a Software 
   Engineer at IQNavigator, Storygize, and Enfuse.io. Here are the technologies I used in each company which I will 
   be able to showcase in this impressive app:
    1. IQNavigator:
       1. Java
       2. Spring
       3. Microservices
       4. Cloud Native
       5. Docker and Kubernetes
       6. Messaging
    2. Storygize:
       1. Cloud
    3. Enfuse.io
       1. DevOps
       2. Spring Cloud Stream
       3. Unit and Integration Testing
       4. Test containers
       5. Angular

    The technologies I wouldn't show here are React, Node.js, and AWS.
2. *Blog every day:* This is to practice technical writing, retrieval practice, talking about what I work on, learn, 
   problems solve, challenges I face.
3. *Code Review:* This is to get 100 code reviews. This will be the second impressive project I have worked on. It 
   will show my ability to mentor junior developers, and perform code reviews as a senior software engineer.
4. *Solve Coding Interview Challenges using JavaScript:* This is to prepare for upcoming interview.
5. *Study through the SWE Interview course from Exponent:* This is also to prepare for upcoming interviews.
