## Spring
1. I used Spring Data to implement the Repository pattern for the separation of concerns.
2. I learned the concept of idempotent operations. They give the same outcome no matter how many times they get run. 
   POST is not an idempotent operations.
3. The 201 CREATED status code should return a Location header in the response.

## JavaScript
1. I used the `includes` and `filter` array methods.
2. I used the `e.target.id` and `.parentElement` to target clicked elements and their parents.
3. I used the `radio` and `checkbox` input types to provide options.
4. I used the `add` and `remove` methods of `classList`
5. I used `querySelector` and `getElementsByClassName` for more powerful grabbing of elements.
