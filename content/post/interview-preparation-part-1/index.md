In preparation for a job interview for a software engineer position, I need to prepare to answer different questions,
practice different things, and do different things. In reality, the preparation for the job interview has been going 
on since the day I wrote my first line of code in 1993. Yes, I have been programming since 1993. That's 30 years. 
30 years of preparation, and I still need to do more preparation. At any rate, back to the main point.

Here are some things as part of my preparation:

## Answer the question: "How do you stay up-to-date?"

I stay up-to-date as a software engineer by doing the following:
### Daily
1. I review code for others.
2. I mentor students and junior developers.
3. I blog about what I learned or worked on.
4. I study with online courses.
5. I contribute to Open Source Projects.

### Weekly
1. I build interesting apps.
2. I read books.

### Monthly
1. I study for and get professional certifications.

### Yearly
1. I attend conferences.
