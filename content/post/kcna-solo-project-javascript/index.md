## KCNA
Yesterday I attended the first part of the O'Reilly KCNA Crash Course with Sander van Vugt. It was a good review of 
the material I already studied in the Linux Foundation course Kubernetes and Cloud Native Essentials. The first part 
covered Cloud Native, Containers, and Kubernetes. Today it will go through the rest of the exam domains: deployment 
and observability.

## Responsive Design 
Yesterday I completed and submitted the solo project for the responsive design module of the Scrimba Frontend 
Developer Career Path. It was a good review of flexbox, relative units, and media queries.

## Next Level JavaScript
I started Module 7: Next Level JavaScript. Key things I reviewed yesterday were objects and destructuring.
