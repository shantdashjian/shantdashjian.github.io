## React
While mentoring a student yesterday, we went through part of the [new React Quick Start document](https://react.dev/learn). 
It is well written and 
goes through 9 key concepts in React:
1. Components
2. Markup
3. Styling
4. Displaying Data
5. Conditional Rendering
6. Lists
7. Responding to Events
8. Updating the Screen
9. Sharing Data between Components

This new and highly anticipated [React documentation](https://react.dev/learn) is well overdue. It introduces 
functional components as the default way to write React component 
   and is written for quick comprehension.

## JavaScript
I continue learning with Scrimba's Frontend Developer Path. Yesterday I looked at:
1. `e.preventDefault()`
2. Three types of HTML buttons:
   1. `type="submit"`: It resets the form fields and submits the form.
   2. `type="reset"`: It resets the form fields without submitting.
   3. `type="button"`: It neither resets nor submits.
3. I noticed the term **taking control of an HTML element** in JavaScript. It means getting a variable to refer to an 
   element, for example like this:

`const form = document.getElementById('form')`
