## Next Level JavaScript
Yesterday I went through the following concepts:
1. `.reduce()`
2. `=>`
3. Ternary operator
4. `setTimeout()`
5. `class`

You use `this` when defining a property inside the `constructor`. Outside the `constructor`, you don't use the 
`function` keyword to define a method, or `this` to declare a property.
