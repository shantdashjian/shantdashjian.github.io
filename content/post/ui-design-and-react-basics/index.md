## UI Design and React Basics
Yesterday I finished the UI Design module. It was a good course in which I built a solid foundation for my 
understanding of UI Design and its 7 fundamentals: WACS-TCH. Today starts a new week, in which I plan to go through 
the last mile with the last 3 modules left: 
1. Module 11: React Basics
2. Module 12: Advanced React
3. Module 13: Getting Hired
I did give the completion of all those modules a week, with 5 hours minimum daily study. Now I understand that it 
   would be more realistic to give it 10 days rather than a week to finish the whole thing. That said, I have a 
   fact-based confidence that I can make it. Why? Because I've already gone through about 25% of the material in the 
   past,
   some of that twice and recently. At any rate, I will maintain focused daily progress towards my goal. I will also 
   maintain my code review a day practice to maintain and strengthen that muscle and maintain my knowledge and 
   experience in all previous modules. This is a good plan. I'll get to work.
