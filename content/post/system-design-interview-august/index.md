I am dedicating the month of August to prepare for system design interviews. This preparation includes:
1. Reading the book [Acing the System Design Interview](https://www.manning.com/books/acing-the-system-design-interview). I will read through 20 pages per day, about one chapter per day, and finish the book in three weeks.
2. Practicing SDIs on [Exponent](tryexponent.com). I will start doing that after I finish the first part of the book about SDI concepts.
3. Reading a blog post from one of the following:
   1. AWS Architecture Blog
   2. Discord Engineering and Developers Blog
   3. Brave Developers Blog
4. Watching a couple of hours of an O'Reilly Live Event on the topic of System Design.
