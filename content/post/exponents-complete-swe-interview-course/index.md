Yesterday I kicked off serious preparation for software engineering interviews using Exponent's **complete** course. 
It's complete because it covers all 3 types of interviews:
1. Coding interview 
2. System design interview 
3. Behavioral interview 

This is a serious course, designed to help software engineers lands jobs at FAANG-level companies. Key learnings 
from what I studied so far:
1. Practice is key. The more I practice for all three kinds of interviews, the better I become prepared.
2. In addition to technical skills and knowledge, communication skills are key. This is a main focus of this program,
   and therefore it encourages daily mock interviews. 
3. Also, there is what's called a **story bank**. It's a reservoir of stories I will prepare based on my previous 
   experience in the industry to answer behavioral questions of the types **tell us about a time** and **what if**.
