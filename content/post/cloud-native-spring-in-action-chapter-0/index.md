In chapter 0, i.e. all the pages before chapter 1 of the book, here are my key learnings:
1. This book is full of useful information. I will learn plenty reading it.
2. This book is about system design. It is system design in action. I will design a system, develop, and deploy it.
3. It has 16 chapters. I would like to study one chapter a day. It is possible to do that.
