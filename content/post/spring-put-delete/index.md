## Spring
Yesterday I wrapped up the first course in the Spring Certified Professional learning path. The course finished with 
implementing the PUT and DELETE actions. A key learning was understanding when to use PUT for creating vs POST. The 
bottom line is that you use PUT for creation when you already have the identifier prior to creation.

I also completed the second course which was an introduction to the rest of the learning path. Then I started with 
the third course: Spring Essentials. So far the course is going fine, although I would have preferred the 
continuation of the TDD approach used in the first course.
