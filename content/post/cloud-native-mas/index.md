I am doing this. I have 25 days left to Christmas. This year I am kicking off my cloud-native-mas, inspired by 
#javascriptmas drive by Scrimba. Here are the numbers:
- 25 days left to Christmas
- 510 pages left to study from the book Cloud Native Spring in Action
- 20 pages / day

I will blog about my progress every day. I am finishing this book this year.
