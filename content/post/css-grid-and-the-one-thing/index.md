## CSS Grid
The key difference between `flex box` and `css grid` is that `flex box` uses one-dimensional layout, either rows or 
columns, while `css grid` uses two-dimensional layout, with both rows and columns. Key `css grid` properties, units, 
and functions are:
1. `display: grid`
2. `grid-template`
3. auto
4. `grid-row`
5. `grid-column`
6. `justify-items`
7. `align-items`
8. `justify-self`
9. `align-self`
10. `grid-gap`
11. `grid-template-areas`
12. `grid-area`
13. `minmax()`
14. `fr`
15. `repeat()`
16. `auto-fill`

## The One Thing
I learned about the goal-oriented learning framework based on the book **The One Thing** by Gary Keller, 
watching a [Travis Media video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsAY11ugTCY&t=13s&ab_channel=TravisMedia). I 
incorporated the framework into my existing focused learning framework and started 
using it today.
